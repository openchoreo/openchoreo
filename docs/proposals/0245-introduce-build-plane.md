## Summary

Currently, all Argo Workflows run on a fixed Kubernetes cluster. This rigid setup limits flexibility in configuring build infrastructure, which can lead to inefficient resource usage or violation of security boundaries.

This proposal introduces a new `BuildPlane` kind that allows users to define a dedicated cluster for executing build workloads. With this, users can:

- Isolate build workloads from runtime environments to improve security and reliability.
- Scale build infrastructure independently of application runtime clusters.
- Select a specific DataPlane or an external cluster to serve as the build environment.

---

## Motivation

Enabling builds to run on any specified cluster gives users greater control over their CI/CD pipelines. This is especially useful when infrastructure separation is required for governance, compliance, or scalability.

---

## Goals

- Allow users to configure the target cluster for Argo Workflows, enabling control over where builds are executed.
- Provide a mechanism to specify container registry configurations for pushing built images.

---

## Non-Goals

- Multi-BuildPlane scheduling and prioritization logic are deferred to a future phase.
- This proposal does not contain image pull logic; it focuses solely on build execution and image pushing.

---

## Impact

- **Build Controller**: Needs updates to support scheduling builds on a specified `BuildPlane`.
- **Build Plane Client**: Logic must be standardized to work across both DataPlane and BuildPlane clusters.
- **DataPlane Resource**: Push registry configuration will be removed; the API will be refactored accordingly.
- **Installation Scripts**: The installation process will need to support creation of the `BuildPlane` resource.

## Design

A `BuildPlane` represents an execution environment for build-related workloads (e.g., building container images, running tests, publishing artifacts). It is backed by a Kubernetes cluster and integrated via Argo Workflows.

It operates via Argo Workflows within its own Kubernetes cluster, separate from both the Control Plane and Data Plane. Each `BuildPlane` is registered using a `BuildPlane` CR, which contains the connection details needed by the Control Plane to delegate build executions.

**Key Benefit**:  
Resource isolation: build workloads do not compete with runtime workloads for cluster resources.

> **Note**: A DataPlane cluster can act as a BuildPlane if explicitly configured.

---

### Considerations

1. Each Component is linked to a single `BuildPlane`.
2. An organization may have multiple `BuildPlanes`, but must define one as the default.
   - Future enhancements (e.g., project-level overrides) can customize this default.
3. All container registries listed in the `BuildPlane` are used for image pushing.
   - Even if not all registries are linked to the component being built.

> **Initial Limitation**: Only one BuildPlane per organization is supported in the initial implementation. Multi-BuildPlane feature will be introduced in future phases.

### CRDs Definitions

#### BuildPlane

```yaml
apiVersion: openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1
kind: BuildPlane
metadata:
   name: example-buildplane
spec:
   # References to ContainerRegistry CRs used for image push operations
   registries:
      - prefix: docker.io/namespace
        secretRef: docker-push-secret
      - prefix: ghcr.io/namespace
        secretRef: ghcr-push-secret
   kubernetesCluster:
      name: test-cluster
      credentials:
         apiServerUrl: https://api.example-cluster
         caCert: <base64-ca-cert>
         clientCert: <base64-client-cert>
         clientKey: <base64-client-key>
```

#### DataPlane

```yaml
apiVersion: openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1
kind: DataPlane
metadata:
   name: example-dataplane
spec:
   # Reference to ContainerRegistry CR used for pulling images
   registry:
      prefix: docker.io/namespace
      secretRef: dockerhub-pull-secret
   kubernetesCluster:
      name: test-cluster
      credentials:
         apiServerUrl: https://api.example-cluster
         caCert: <base64-ca-cert>
         clientCert: <base64-client-cert>
         clientKey: <base64-client-key>
```
